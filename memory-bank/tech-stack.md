# Tech Stack: Go Microservices Online Shop

This document outlines the proposed and recommended technology stack for the Go Microservices Online Shop project.

## 1. Core Backend & Language
* **Programming Language:** Go
    * *Reasoning:* Mandated by project requirements. Excellent for microservices due to performance, concurrency features, and strong standard library.
* **Build & Dependency Management:** Go Modules
    * *Reasoning:* Standard for Go projects for managing dependencies and versions.

## 2. Microservice Communication
* **Framework:** gRPC
    * *Reasoning:* Mandated by project requirements for efficient, contract-based inter-service communication.
* **Interface Definition Language (IDL):** Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)
    * *Reasoning:* Mandated by project requirements. Used to define gRPC service contracts and message structures.

## 3. Public API Layer (Per Microservice)
* **API Design:** RESTful HTTP Endpoints
    * *Reasoning:* Mandated by project requirements for external client interaction.
* **HTTP Router/Framework:** (Choose one per service, or standardize)
    * **Options:**
        * `net/http` (Go Standard Library): For simpler APIs or no external dependencies.
        * `gorilla/mux`: Popular, flexible, and robust router.
        * `gin-gonic`: Performance-focused framework with a good feature set.
        * `chi`: Lightweight, idiomatic, and composable router.
    * *Reasoning:* Needed to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware. Choice depends on desired features and complexity.
* **Data Serialization:** JSON
    * *Reasoning:* Standard for RESTful APIs. Go has excellent built-in support (`encoding/json`).

## 4. Data Persistence (Per Microservice as needed)
* **Database System:** (Choose one, can vary per microservice if justified)
    * **Relational Options:**
        * PostgreSQL: Powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
        * MySQL: Widely used open-source relational database.
    * **NoSQL Options:**
        * MongoDB: Popular document-oriented NoSQL database.
    * *Reasoning:* Required for data storage. Choice depends on data structure, scalability needs, and team familiarity.
* **Database Driver/ORM (Go):** (Choose based on selected Database System)
    * **For PostgreSQL:**
        * `database/sql` + `pq` or `pgx` (driver)
        * `sqlx` (extension to `database/sql`)
        * `GORM` (ORM)
    * **For MySQL:**
        * `database/sql` + `go-sql-driver/mysql` (driver)
        * `sqlx`
        * `GORM`
    * **For MongoDB:**
        * `mongo-go-driver` (official MongoDB driver)
    * *Reasoning:* To interact with the chosen database from Go applications.

## 5. Concurrency
* **Primitives:** Goroutines and Channels
    * *Reasoning:* Mandated by project requirements. Core Go features for concurrent programming.

## 6. Testing & Benchmarking
* **Testing Framework:** Standard Go `testing` package
    * *Reasoning:* Mandated by project requirements for unit and benchmark tests.
* **Assertion Libraries (Recommended):**
    * `testify/assert`: For expressive assertions in tests.
    * `testify/require`: Similar to assert but stops test execution on failure.
    * *Reasoning:* Improves readability and conciseness of tests.
* **Mocking Libraries (Recommended for complex dependencies):**
    * `testify/mock`: For creating mock objects.
    * `gomock`: Google's mocking framework for Go.
    * *Reasoning:* To isolate units of code during testing by mocking dependencies.

## 7. Logging
* **Base:** Standard Go `log` package
    * *Reasoning:* Built-in, suitable for simple logging.
* **Structured Logging Libraries (Recommended):**
    * `slog` (Go 1.21+): New structured logging package in the standard library.
    * `zerolog`: High-performance, zero-allocation JSON logger.
    * `logrus`: Popular structured logger, though `slog` or `zerolog` might be preferred for new projects.
    * *Reasoning:* Provides more context, easier parsing, and better integration with log management systems.

## 8. Configuration Management
* **Primary Method:** Environment Variables
    * *Reasoning:* Standard practice for cloud-native applications (12-factor app).
* **File-based Configuration (Optional):**
    * Libraries like `viper` or `godotenv` (for local development).
    * *Reasoning:* Useful for managing complex configurations or local development overrides.

## 9. Documentation
* **Project Documentation:** Markdown (`.md` files)
    * *Reasoning:* Simple, widely used for code project documentation.
* **API Documentation (Bonus):**
    * Swagger / OpenAPI Specification
    * **Go Tools:** `swaggo/swag` (to generate Swagger docs from Go code comments).
    * *Reasoning:* Mandated as a bonus. Provides interactive and standardized API documentation.

## 10. DevOps & Deployment (Conceptual for AI implementation, practical for real-world)
* **Version Control:** Git
    * *Reasoning:* Standard for version control.
* **Containerization:** Docker
    * *Reasoning:* To package applications and their dependencies consistently. Facilitates local development and deployment.
* **Container Orchestration (Conceptual for this project):**
    * Kubernetes: For scalable and resilient deployment of microservices.
    * Docker Compose: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications locally.
    * *Reasoning:* Essential for managing microservices in production environments.
* **CI/CD (Conceptual):**
    * Tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins.
    * *Reasoning:* To automate testing, building, and deployment pipelines.

This tech stack provides a solid foundation for building a robust and scalable online shop using Go microservices. The specific choices for databases and HTTP routers can be finalized based on more detailed requirements for each microservice or team preference.
