# User Service Implementation Summary

## Architecture Overview

The User Service has been implemented as a complete microservice following modern Go practices and patterns. It provides both RESTful HTTP and gRPC APIs for user management operations.

## Key Components

1. **API Definitions**
   - Protocol Buffers for defining gRPC service contracts
   - RESTful HTTP endpoints using the Chi router

2. **Domain Layer**
   - Clean domain models with clear interfaces
   - Separation of concerns between repository, service, and handler layers

3. **Persistence Layer**
   - PostgreSQL database for storing user data
   - Repository pattern for data access abstraction
   - Database connection pooling for performance

4. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Service implementation for user management operations
   - Password hashing and security
   - Comprehensive input validation

5. **API Layer**
   - HTTP handlers for RESTful API endpoints
   - gRPC server implementation
   - Error handling and proper status codes

6. **Containerization**
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized production images
   - Docker Compose for local development and testing

7. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with mock repositories
   - Test coverage for critical business logic

## Development Process

The implementation followed a layered approach:
1. First, defined the API contracts using Protocol Buffers
2. Created domain models and interfaces
3. Implemented the repository layer for data persistence
4. Built the service layer with the business logic
5. Added API handlers (both HTTP and gRPC)
6. Set up containerization
7. Added tests and documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test the User Service in a containerized environment
2. Implement integration tests with a real PostgreSQL database
3. Add more advanced validation for email addresses and other fields
4. Enhance the service with additional features like password reset and email confirmation
5. Integrate with other microservices for cross-service operations
