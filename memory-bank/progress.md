# Implementation Progress

## Phase 0: Project Initialization & Planning

- [x] **0.1. Define Microservice Boundaries:**

  - [x] Documented responsibilities and functionalities in architecture.md
  - [x] Established criteria for boundary decisions (business capability, bounded context, scalability, team expertise)
  - [x] Ensured design addresses core business drivers

- [x] **0.2. Setup Go Development Environment:**

  - [x] Git repository initialized
  - [x] .gitignore file created
  - [x] Branching strategy defined

- [x] **0.4. Choose Database:**
  - [x] Selected databases:
    - Product Service: MongoDB (document store for flexible product data)
    - User Service: PostgreSQL (relational for structured user data)
    - Order Service: PostgreSQL (relational for order transactions)
    - Auth Service: Redis (in-memory for fast token management)
  - [x] Documented justification for each choice in architecture.md

- [x] **0.5. API Design Philosophy:**
  - [x] Reviewed RESTful principles
  - [x] Decided on API versioning with `/v1/` prefix
  - [x] Planned general API structure

- [x] **0.6. Authentication & Authorization Strategy:**
  - [x] Designed centralized authentication service
  - [x] Planned for decentralized authorization
  - [x] Defined token-based authentication approach

- [x] **0.7. Communication Patterns Definition:**
  - [x] Defined primary pattern as request-response (unary gRPC)
  - [x] Identified streaming use cases
  - [x] Documented patterns in architecture.md

- [x] **0.8. Error Handling Strategy:**
  - [x] Defined standard gRPC status codes
  - [x] Established guidelines for custom error types
  - [x] Created error propagation strategy

- [x] **0.9. Data Consistency Approach:**
  - [x] Decided on eventual consistency with event-based patterns
  - [x] Planned Saga patterns for critical flows
  - [x] Documented in architecture.md

- [x] **0.10. Performance Requirements:**
  - [x] Established target metrics (sub-100ms responses, 1000 req/s, 99.9% availability)
  - [x] Determined benchmarking approach
  - [x] Created performance testing plan

- [x] **0.11. Monitoring & Observability Plan:**
  - [x] Selected OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
  - [x] Chose Prometheus for metrics
  - [x] Defined structured logging standards
  - [x] Planned alerting thresholds

## Phase 1: Core Microservice Development

### Product Service (COMPLETED)

- [x] **1.1. Project Structure for Microservice:**
  - [x] Created directory for the microservice
  - [x] Initialized Go modules
  - [x] Defined standard subdirectories (cmd, internal/domain, internal/repository, etc.)

- [x] **1.2. gRPC Communication Definition (Protocol Buffers):**
  - [x] Created product.proto file
  - [x] Defined service methods (RPCs) for internal communication
  - [x] Defined message structures for requests and responses
  - [x] Generated Go code from .proto file

- [x] **1.3. gRPC Server Implementation:**
  - [x] Implemented the gRPC server interface
  - [x] Written business logic for each RPC method
  - [x] Implemented basic error handling for gRPC methods

- [x] **1.4. Public HTTP Endpoints (RESTful):**
  - [x] Chosen chi router framework
  - [x] Designed RESTful endpoints with API versioning (/v1/products)
  - [x] Implemented handlers for HTTP endpoints
  - [x] Connected handlers to business logic

- [x] **1.5. Data Persistence:**
  - [x] Designed MongoDB schema for products
  - [x] Chosen official MongoDB Go driver
  - [x] Implemented database connection logic
  - [x] Implemented CRUD operations
  - [x] Added data validation

- [x] **1.6. Concurrency and Error Handling:**
  - [x] Identified areas for goroutines and channels
  - [x] Implemented robust error handling
  - [x] Added structured logging

- [x] **1.7. Unit Testing:**
  - [x] Written unit tests for business logic
  - [x] Used testify for assertions and mocking

- [x] **1.8. Benchmarking (Critical Components):**
  - [x] Identified performance-critical functions (CreateProduct, ListProducts, UpdateInventory, CheckStock)
  - [x] Written benchmarks for these functions
  - [x] Validated sub-millisecond performance on critical operations

- [x] **1.9. Configuration Management:**
  - [x] Implemented environment variable-based configuration

- [x] **1.10. Observability Integration:**
  - [x] Added health check endpoints
  - [x] Prepared metrics collection endpoints
  - [x] Implemented structured logging

- [x] **1.11. Deployment Configuration:**
  - [x] Created Dockerfile with multi-stage build
  - [x] Created docker-compose configuration for local development
  - [x] Updated documentation with build and run instructions

### User Service (NOT STARTED)

### Order Service (NOT STARTED)

### Auth Service (NOT STARTED)

## Next Steps

1. Start implementing User Service
2. Test Product Service in containerized environment
3. Begin implementing inter-service communication (Phase 2)
