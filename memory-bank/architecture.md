# Go Microservices Online Shop - Architecture

## Microservice Boundaries

Based on our implementation plan, we've identified the following core domains for our online shop:

### 1. Product Service
**Responsibility:** Manages the product catalog and inventory.
- Product information management (name, description, price, images)
- Inventory tracking and stock management
- Product categorization and search
- Product reviews and ratings

### 2. User Service
**Responsibility:** Handles user accounts and authentication.
- User registration and profile management
- Authentication and authorization
- User preferences and settings
- Address management

### 3. Order Service
**Responsibility:** Manages the ordering process.
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order creation and management
- Order history and tracking
- Payment processing integration

### 4. Auth Service (Centralized)
**Responsibility:** Centralized authentication and authorization.
- Token generation and validation
- User authentication
- Integration with other services for authorization

## Database Choices

We're implementing a polyglot persistence approach, selecting the optimal database for each microservice's needs:

### Product Service
**Database:** MongoDB
**Justification:** 
- Products have varying attributes and schemas depending on category
- Document-oriented model fits well with product catalog data
- Good performance for read-heavy operations and product searches
- Easily scalable for large product catalogs

### User Service
**Database:** PostgreSQL
**Justification:**
- Structured user data with relationships
- Strong data consistency requirements for user information
- ACID compliance for user transactions
- Robust support for complex queries on user data

### Order Service
**Database:** PostgreSQL
**Justification:**
- Transaction support for order processing
- Relational integrity for order items and statuses
- Complex queries for order reporting
- ACID properties essential for payment-related operations

### Auth Service
**Database:** Redis
**Justification:**
- High-performance token storage and validation
- Fast read/write operations for authentication processes
- Built-in expiration for tokens
- In-memory operations for minimal latency in auth checks

## Communication Patterns

### Inter-Service Communication
- **Primary Pattern:** Request-Response (Unary gRPC)
  - Used for most service interactions where immediate responses are needed
  - Example: Order Service requesting product information from Product Service

- **Streaming Use Cases:**
  - Real-time inventory updates from Product Service to Order Service
  - User session activity monitoring

### API Communication Design
- All services expose RESTful HTTP endpoints with `/v1/` versioning
- Internal communication uses gRPC
- Event-based patterns for eventual consistency

## Error Handling Strategy

- Standard gRPC status codes across all services
- Custom error types with contextual information
- Structured logging for all errors
- Consistent error propagation between services

## Data Consistency Approach

- Eventual consistency with event-based patterns for most operations
- Saga patterns for critical transaction flows, especially order processing
- Event sourcing for order history

## Performance Targets

- API response times: sub-100ms
- System capacity: 1000 requests/second
- System availability: 99.9%

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Distributed Tracing:** OpenTelemetry
- **Metrics:** Prometheus
- **Logging:** Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Health Checks:** Standardized endpoints for all services

## Deployment Strategy

- Cloud-agnostic containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management
